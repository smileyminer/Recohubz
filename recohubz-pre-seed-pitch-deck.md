#### **Slide 2: The Problem**

* Addiction is a rising global health crisis.
* Public healthcare is overwhelmed; digital users often fall through the cracks.
* A growing subset of people are addicted to crypto trading, NFTs, and online gambling-like behaviors.
* Many suffer in silence due to stigma, isolation, or distrust in traditional systems.
* No trusted, decentralized platform exists for long-term, digital-first recovery.

***

#### **Slide 3: The Opportunity**

* Web3, AI, and IoT can be repurposed to solve pressing human health problems.
* Blockchain users—especially those harmed by crypto—can become the first cohort for research and care.
* Emerging biotech and real-time health data offer new ways to monitor, support, and measure recovery.
* The shift to digital living requires digital-first recovery tools with ethical foundations.
