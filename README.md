# RecoHubz Pitch Deck: 1. Executive Summary

**RecoHubz** is a Web3-based protocol that integrates existing on-chain technologies—such as Proof of Humanity, on-chain reputation systems, and decentralized finance (DeFi)—with emerging innovations in biotechnology and IoT-enabled healthcare. The goal is to create alternative recovery pathways for individuals struggling with addiction.

Biotechnology is reshaping how we detect and treat illness, while IoT devices enable healthcare monitoring and delivery across a range of environments. At the same time, AI is driving unprecedented innovation across industries. However, its broader impact on society, particularly on mental health and well-being, remains largely unmeasured.

As more people live increasingly digital lives—and with automation threatening traditional employment—social and digital isolation are expected to rise. For individuals with addiction or mental health challenges, who already face stigma and barriers to accessing traditional care, a new kind of support system is urgently needed.

**RecoHubz** offers anonymous, trustworthy access to digital treatments focused on long-term relapse prevention. It is both ambitious and grounded in practicality—building a self-sustaining recovery economy that empowers individuals. When they're ready, users can also choose to access real-world care and support.

Through a two-tier DAO governance model, RecoHubz enables both professionals and the wider community to participate in funding and decision-making. Addicts can build a verifiable on-chain reputation, helping them pursue employment and, eventually, access credit—offering not just treatment, but a true second chance.

The long-term mission: a global, decentralized, and privacy-first addiction recovery network.
